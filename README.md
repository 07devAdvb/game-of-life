# Game-of-Life with Ebitengine

## This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Ebitengine.

In case you know what is the Game of Life, it is a simulation experiment in which you hace "cells" or "citizens" in a grid, and the factor which determins wether they live or die is the following:

- If it has 2 or 3 living neighbours it lives.
- Else, it dies.

This simple pair of rules can lead to interesting patterns in which the tital number of cells increases forever, remains stable after a while, or all of them die leaving an empty universe behind.
